<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>

<p>Blockchain is a technology that stores digital information on a distributed network. The term "blockchain" is derived from the two words "block" and "chain". Each block contains specific information, and these blocks are connected in a chain format in chronological order. Once the information is recorded, it cannot be changed or deleted. To add new information, a new block must be connected to the chain.</p>
<p>The series of blocks in a blockchain are also referred to as a "ledger" or "book". Since this ledger is shared among all participants of the blockchain network, the information on the blockchain is transparently accessible.</p>
<p>The core advantage of blockchain is its security and reliability. To manipulate the ledger, the consensus of most of the network participants is needed, making it almost impossible to forge or tamper with.</p>
<p>Blockchain is utilized in various fields such as currency, contracts, logistics, and evidence. Several countries are adopting blockchain to digitize their national currencies. Especially, some developing countries are already using blockchain as their legal tender.</p>

<h2>PERMAPICS and Blockchain</h2>
<p>PERMAPICS utilizes the immutability of blockchain to ensure that there are no management costs after uploading photos, offering a method to preserve photos permanently without the need for additional management.</p>
<p>Considering the continuous development and proliferation of blockchain, using PERMAPICS for photo management is expected to become a more natural choice in the future.</p>
