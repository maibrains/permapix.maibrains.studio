<h2>Development Motivation</h2>
<p>From the dawn of digital cameras to the present smartphone era, we have increasingly been able to digitize our memorable moments more easily and simply.</p>
<p>As time has passed, while it's become easier and more convenient to capture these moments, ironically, the task of storing and managing the growing photo folders has become more challenging and demanding.</p>
<p>The struggle of categorizing and storing photos, concerns about the lifespan of hard drives and CDs or potential loss from physical damages, the practice of just uploading everything to the cloud, the monthly increasing cloud maintenance costs, and the growing security threats from hackers targeting cloud storages.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we created PERMAPICS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Features of PERMAPICS</h2>
<p>Now, with PERMAPICS, you can store, manage, secure, and even bequeath your photos. Escape the troubles and costs associated with photo storage and management.</p>
<p>PERMAPICS utilizes blockchain network technology. With global blockchain nodes preserving copies of your photos, the fear of loss is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>There are no additional costs after the initial charge to record a photo on the blockchain. Thus, once uploaded, there are absolutely no costs for storage or maintenance.</p>
<p>Your photos are encrypted and managed solely by the private key you own. While the data recorded on the chain is public, just as only the owner can transfer Bitcoin, your photos are securely managed by the same principle.</p>
<p>With these features, all the photos you upload can be passed down to future generations. There's no need to hand over numerous physically stored hard drives or CDs. Simply transfer the private key.</p>
<p>Even if PERMAPICS disappears, your data remains safe. As long as the blockchain exists, it will be preserved indefinitely.</p>

<h2>How to Use PERMAPICS</h2>
<p>The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of PERMAPICS is currently in alpha testing. It will soon be available for download on the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
